Classifying movies based on there genere
I have developed a robust machine learning model utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately predict movie genres based on textual data such as plot summaries. By leveraging advanced techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, the model efficiently analyzes and classifies movies into various genres with high precision and reliability.
